## Project Title
One-Time Pad Cipher - A Secure Encryption Technique

## Description
This project implements a One-Time Pad (OTP) cipher using Python and Streamlit. The OTP is an encryption technique that ensures absolute secrecy when used correctly. This application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a randomly generated or user-provided key, making it a great learning tool for cryptography enthusiasts.

## Dependencies
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit library
- A code editor e.g Visual Studio Code

## Installing
To install Streamlit:
```sh
pip install streamlit
```
Clone this repository using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amusEcode1/OneTimePad.git
```
Navigate to the Cloned Repository:
```sh
cd OneTimePad
```

## Running the Application
To start the Streamlit application, run the following command:
```sh
streamlit run OTP.py
```

## Help
If you encounter any issues:
- Check the [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- Search for solutions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/streamlit)
- Open an issue in this repository
